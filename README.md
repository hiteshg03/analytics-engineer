# ðŸ“Š Analytics Engineering Bootcamp â€” Project

This project demonstrates my learnings from the **Analytics Engineer Bootcamp** by *Rahul Prasad*.  
It focuses on building **scalable ELT pipelines** and **data warehouse models** using **dbt** and **BigQuery**, aligned with **modern data stack principles**.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Designed and implemented **dimensional data models** (Kimball, Inmon) for analytics-ready datasets  
- Built modular **dbt models** with **tests**, **documentation**, and **Git-based version control**  
- Implemented **CI/CD pipelines** to ensure **data reliability**, **transparency**, and **governance**  
- Explored core concepts such as **OLTP vs OLAP**, **ETL vs ELT**, and **data modeling best practices**  
- Delivered a **cloud-based data warehouse** optimized for performance and scalability  

---

## ðŸ§  Tools & Technologies
- **dbt (Data Build Tool)**  
- **Google BigQuery**  
- **Git & GitHub** for version control  
- **CI/CD pipelines** for automation and testing  

---

## ðŸ“š Concepts Covered
- Data Warehousing & Modeling (Inmon, Kimball, Data Vault, OBT)  
- OLTP vs OLAP systems  
- Normalization & Denormalization  
- ELT workflows and modular transformations  
- Documentation, testing, and data quality management  

---

## ðŸ§© Project Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience designing and deploying a **dimensional data warehouse** using dbt and BigQuery, following **modern data stack practices** for scalable, maintainable, and well-documented analytics workflows.
